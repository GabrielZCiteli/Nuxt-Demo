# Humanity Forward's Citizenship Portal

## Get Started

This app was bootstrapped with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org)

Welcome to a world where everyone can benefit from the information age  
Our goal is to create a citizenship portal for the citizens of the United States of America  
This repo contains the project's front-end

If you find something you like and wanna get started, follow the instructions below to get up and running  

### Dependencies

- NodeJS 10.14.x or newer
- See Package.json for a complete list of packages required

If you are likely to need to manage multiple version of node on your local machine, we recommend version managers such as [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) or [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md).

For those new to Node, the following tutorial will help get you up to speed with configuring a [Node environment](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/).
